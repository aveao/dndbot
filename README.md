# DNDBot

This project should not be an indicator of my programming skills, at least it shouldn't be a negative indicator. This was a project sticked together in 30 minutes at 4am, just to make it work. 

I still tried to make it not-terrible by dividing stuff into proper functions and using logging and configparser and all that, but it's far from perfect.

Are you too lazy to get out of bed to put your Linux™ PC™ with PulseAudio™ on mute?

Do you often go on DnD (Do Not Disturb) mode from your phone, in bed?

Wouldn't it be great if going on DnD just muted your computer too?

Now it can, with DNDBot™! (god why)


Just:
- install `python3` (3.6+ needed)
- install `discord.py` (this project still uses async smh)
- copy `dndbot.ini.example` to `dndbot.ini`
- put your userid and a token (of a bot you share servers with) in
- run the script
- enjoy!
- optional: use smth like pm2 to keep it running and to make it start again after reboots.
