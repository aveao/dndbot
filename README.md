# dndbot

not *that* sort of dnd.

Are you too lazy to get out of bed to put your PC on mute?

Do you often go on DnD (Do Not Disturb) mode from your phone, in bed?

Wouldn't it be great if going on DnD just muted your computer too?

Now it can, with DnDBot! (god why)


Just:
- install `python3` (3.5+ needed)
- install `discord.py` (this project still uses async smh)
- copy `dndbot.ini.example` to `dndbot.ini`
- put your userid and a token (of a bot you share servers with) in
- run the script
- enjoy!
- optional: use smth like pm2 to keep it running and to make it start again after reboots.
